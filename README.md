# WUZZUF-Web-Scrapping-Script
Web scraping is a very powerful choise when it comes to data collection. It automates repetitive tasks, saves time and effort as well. So, when it comes to web scraping and data cleaning automation, Python can take over all of these tasks. It has so many capabilities to just do what you need after defining a script and then the same task will be performed with a button click!

**In this project I used many libraries to do the job such as:**
- **BeautifulSoup**: Navigates to the needed website, scrape the data after identifying `HTML` elements.
- **Pandas**: Cleans, organises the data, creates a data frame and saves it into an Excel file.
- **os**: Responsible for files and folders management on the system.
- **Tkinter**: Creates a simple GUI that makes it easier than just typing the needed *job* into the terminal.
